<p>All life exchanges molecules with the environment. These molecules link organisms and impact the function, health, and sustainability of ecosystems. The Sogin lab explores how microorganisms use molecules to interact with their eukaryotic hosts and their environment. We employ a cross-disciplinary approach that combines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics">metabolomic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics">metaâ€™omic</a> analyses with experimental manipulations to disentangle microbial interactions. Our goal is to define how habitats and hosts shape the assemblage of complex microbiomes.</p>

<p>I will be starting my lab at UC Merced in January 2021.My research predominately focuses on exploring host microbe interactions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zostera_marina">seagrasses</a>. However,my passion is for exploring how eukaryote <strong>hosts</strong>, <strong>symbionts</strong> and <strong>the environment</strong> interact.</p>

    All life exchanges molecules with the environment. 
    These molecules link organisms and impact the function, health, 
    and sustainability of ecosystems. 
    As microbiologist with a passion for symbiosis research, 
    I investigate how microorganisms interact with one another, 
    eukaryotic hosts, and their habitat. I employ a cross-disciplinary 
    approach that combines metabolomic and metagenomic analyses with 
    experimental manipulations to disentangle microbial interactions. 
    My goal is to define habitat and host processes that shape the 
    assemblage of complex microbiomes.

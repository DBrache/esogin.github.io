Welcome to the Sogin Lab at UC Merced. Our new site is up and running and read for business. In creating this site, I became interested in learning new ways to present my groups work to the outside world. My goal is to foster community through science communication and highlight the advances my group makes in our contribution to research. I believe this will help increase transparency in our work both in and out of the lab.

This site takes advantage of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework for hosting sites and [github pages](https://pages.github.com). Therefore, and importantly, it is open source. It is also an experiment for me which will evolve over time as my group begins to grow.

Welcome to the Sogin Lab at UC Merced. Our new site is up and running and ready for business. My goal by creating this site is to present my groups work and to develop community through science communication. This also includes highlighting the ongoing activities in my reseach program and the advances my group makes in our contribution to science. I believe this will help increase transparency in our work both in and out of the lab.

This site takes advantage of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) framework for hosting sites and [github pages](https://pages.github.com). Therefore, and importantly, it is open source. It is also an experiment for me which will evolve over time as my group begins to grow.

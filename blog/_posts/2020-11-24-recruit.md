We are interested in developing a laboratory model for manipulating the microbiome of seagrasses. PIs Eisen, Stachowicz and Sogin recently received funding from the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/initiative-strategy-detail?initiativeId=symbiosis-in-aquatic-systems-initiative) to develop methods and share protocols for manipulating the microbiome of the seagrass, *Zostera marina*. 

*Z. marina* is an intriguing model for symbiosis research because seagrasses - generally - and *Z. marina* - in particular - 	

- Are ecological and economically important
- Excellent models for comparative and evolutionary studies of host-microbiome interactions, and *Z. marina* specifically 
- *Z. marina* Is an emerging model for seagrasses, with a large body of literature and an active, collaborative community of researchers facilitated by the Zostera Experimental Network (ZEN)
- *Z. marina* is abundant and widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, is highly amenable to diverse field and lab experimental studies because it is readily accessible, can be reared in controlled conditions, is easily cloned or grown from seed, has a moderately small genome, and can be transplanted to reciprocal locations or common gardens 
- *Z. marina* ‘omic resources are becoming increasingly more [available] (https://tinyurl.com/ZosteraResources) including a high quality genome assembly, a large population genomic dataset, multiple transcriptomes, and growing ‘omic data for other seagrasses and their aquatic relatives.

The goal of our Symbiosis Model Systems award is to facilitate the development, improvement and sharing of protocols targeted the following aims: 

- Producing, processing and germinating *Z. marina* seeds under controlled laboratory conditions 
- Reducing microbiome transmission to offspring during seed germination and clonal propagation 
- Rasing *Z. marina* from seed and clonal propagates in sterilized or microbial reduced sediments and seawater

Ultimately, we aim to develop a tool kit that will allow us to reintroduce and test the effects of microbes (alone or in consortia) and *Z. marina’s* physiology and metabolism.

Her research interests focus on understanding the symbiotic relationships between hosts and their microbiome, with a particular interest on how these relationships are influenced by their environment.
She Completed her B.S. in Marine Science at Eckerd College where she wrote her undergraduate thesis on bacterial community stability in Aiptasia in response to heat stress. 

After completing her degree, she went on to work at the Central Caribbean Marine Institute where she assisted on projects investigating Coral Resilience, and at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene where she worked as a Lab Microbiologist during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

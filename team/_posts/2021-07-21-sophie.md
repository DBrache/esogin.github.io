Maggie is an Assistant Professor in the Molecular Cell Biology Department at UC Merced since January 2021.

Maggie's research interests are centered towards understanding host-microbial interactions in marine taxa. She completed her PhD in Dr. Ruth Gates Laboratory at the University of Hawaii and the [Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology](http://www.himb.hawaii.edu). During her time in Hawaii, she developed and applied metabolomic techniques towards understanding the microbial interactions in reef-building corals. 

After compeleting her PhD, she joined Dr. Nicole Dubilier's [Department of Symbiosis](https://www.mpi-bremen.de/Abteilung-Symbiose.html) at the [Max Planck Insitute for Marine Microbology](https://www.mpi-bremen.de/Max-Planck-Institut-fuer-Marine-Mikrobiologie-in-Bremen.html) in Bremen, Germany. During her time at the MPI, she developed a strong interested in exploring how seagrasses modify their habitat to influence the microbial community living in their rhizospheres. She also became involved in projects exploring the biology of chemosymbioses in both gutless worms and deep-sea mussels. 

When outside of the lab and field environments, Maggie enjoys rock climbing, surfing, and camping.

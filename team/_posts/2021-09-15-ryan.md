Ryan is a Graduate Student in the Quantitative and Systems Biology program at UC Merced. Ryan is co-advised by Drs. E. Maggie Sogin and Gordon Bennett. 

His research interests are aimed towards understanding host-microbial interactions within insect systems. In addition, he is generally interested in the range of beneficial to maladaptive effects microbes may elicit within their host -- with special considerations for biological control applications, biogeography, and our dynamic climate.
He completed a Masters of Science in Public Health (Spring 2021) where he examined _Wolbachia_ infection status and strain type within 12 mosquito species in Merced County -- with an overarching goal to inform potential biological control applications.

When outside of the lab and field environments, Ryan enjoys staying active, cooking, and gardening.

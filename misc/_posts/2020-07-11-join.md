# Join us!

The Sogin Lab is on the hunt for students, technicians and post-docs staring in January 2021! If you are interested in joining us at [UC Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu) in the [Molecular & Cellular Biology Department](https://naturalsciences.ucmerced.edu/content/molecular-cell-biology), please get in contact with me. 

I am committed to providing an inclusive environment that welcomes *all* people who are passionate about marine symbioses and microbiology. 

My leadership philosophy centers around the notion that we all have differing experiences and backgrounds. This diversity makes us stronger together, however it also means that leaders need to be flexible in their leadership approach. I am committed to providing the leadership that each member of the lab needs. As we evolve as a group and mentor/mentee relationship, I anticipate type of leadership will also change. Which is why I am committed to maintain an open dialog throughout the course of your time in the Sogin Lab.  


### For interested students: 

The Sogin lab can accept students from the [QSB graduate program](https://qsb.ucmerced.edu).

My expectations for students entering the lab: 

1. Open communication between student and advisor(s), including co-developing mentorship/mentee plans. 
2. Willingness to contribute to and create a healthy, *non-toxic* atmosphere. Regardless of the program you choose for your Ph.D. it is essential to take care of, and maintain, your mental health. 
3. Willingness to co-develop applications for fellowships, grants, etc.
4. Desire to *become* independent in your work and develop your own ideas. It is *not* necessary for you to start this way, but I want you to become a *confident* scientist as you progress through your degree. 

If you are still interested in joining the Sogin lab please send me an email (esogin@gmail.com) with the following: 

* A brief description of your research interests and how they overlap with the interests of the lab
* A summary of your research experience 
* A CV including professional references and GPA
* If you are eligible to apply for graduate research fellowships (e.g., NSF GRFP, EPA-Star, Nancy Foster, etc.). I ask all prospective graduate students who are eligible to apply; Iâ€™m happy to discuss research ideas, comment on application drafts, etc.

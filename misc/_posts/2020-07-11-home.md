All life exchanges molecules with the environment. These molecules link organisms and impact the function, health, and sustainability of ecosystems. As microbiologists, we study how microorganisms interact with one another, eukaryotic hosts, and their habitat. 

Our research employs a cross-disciplinary approach that combines metabolomic and metagenomic analyses with experimental manipulations to disentangle microbial interactions. The Sogin's lab overall reserach goal is to explore **how environment and host processes**  shape the assemblage of **complex microbiomes** across **marine ecosystems**.

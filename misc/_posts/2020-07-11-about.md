# Design and Implementation

This site was adapted from the [Drummond lab](http://drummondlab.org/about.html) and [Trevor Bedford]'s clean, elegant, and functional [site][1]. This is the first site I ever developed and I was inspired by the beautiful sites that take advantage of [Jekyll Bootstrap] and [GitHub Pages]. 

Keeping with a major Jekyll Bootstrap idea, the site separates content and presentation. Presentation information is stored in a new theme, the `lab` theme, which may be useful to other research groups setting up sites.

By using [Sass] for stylesheets, the site gets virtually all the advantages of using [Less], while exploiting native Sass support in [GitHub Pages]. The site uses [Google Fonts] as well, primarily [Open Sans].

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license. You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, please attribute the Drummond lab back [here](http://drummondlab.org/about.html).
